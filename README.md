# The Queen's Workers
A collaborative game project BGMC 21

## How to play

1. Start the game in launcher.blend
2. Select ants with RMB+drag (box select). Good blender training, using RMB select ;)
3. LMB command ants; Pressing LMB on a resource tells the selected ants to collect it
4. Build buildings to process collected resources more efficiently
5. Enjoy!

^^^ that was a big hint - you wouldn't have possibly found the buttons to activate the Easter Egg without reading this file.
