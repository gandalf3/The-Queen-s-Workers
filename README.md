# The Queen's Workers
A collaborative game project BGMC 21

## How to play

1. Start the game in launcher.blend
2. Select ants with RMB+drag (box select). Good blender training, using RMB select ;)
3. LMB command ants; Pressing LMB on a resource tells the selected ants to collect it
4. Build buildings to process collected resources more efficiently. 
5. Activate built resource buildings by delivering the apropriate resource to them. (honey for the honey farm, and leafs for the fungus farm)
6. A large resource farm building will produce 10 food for every 1 food resource delivered to it. a small resource farm building will produce 5 food for every 1 delivered to it.
7. Enjoy!

Made by:

* ARadish         concept, modeling, art, etc
* gandalf3        game mechanics. python. pretty much evreything else. (made everything look cool and actually work)
* GiantCowFilms   python patching, the mini map mechanics, and messing stuff up
* X27            building system, end sequence, other miscolanious game mechanics, some prettyifiying, and implemented the real, (hard to find) easter egg. 

^^^ here is another big hint for the Easter Egg: Notice, it does not say, "X-27" but only "X27."

For those of you having a *really hard time* finding it, here is another hint: "Use the numpad, and don't release until your done"
