# The Queen's Workers
A collaborative game project BGMC 21

## How to play

1. Start the game in launcher.blend
2. Select ants with RMB+drag (box select). Good blender training, using RMB select ;)
3. LMB command ants; Pressing LMB on a resource tells the selected ants to collect it
4. Build buildings to process collected resources more efficiently. 
5. Activate built resource buildings by delivering the apropriate resource to them. (honey for the honey farm, and leafs for the fungus farm)
6. Enjoy!

Made by:

* ARadish         concept, modeling, art, etc
* gandalf3        game mechanics. python. pretty much evreything else. (made everything look cool and actually work)
* GiantCowFilms   python patching, the mini map mechanics, and messing stuff up
* X-27            building system, end sequence, other miscolanious game mechanics, some prettyifiying, and implemented the real, (hard to find) easter egg. 

^^^ that was a big hint - you wouldn't have possibly found which buttons activate the Easter Egg without reading this file.
